## Ruby Review

![ruby](http://media2.giphy.com/media/12jdalMQkt7iM/200.gif)

Time to freshen up your Ruby skills! **Fork (really important!)** and clone this lab.

Follow the instructions and write your code in `ruby_review.rb`.

Run `bundle install` to install the Gems you need, then run `rspec --fail-fast` to run the tests to make sure your code is working properly.

Once you get all of your tests passing make sure that the lab is forked onto your own account

  ** check this by typing `git remote -v` in the terminal - you should see your github username **

then push your work onto github with the following commands:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "tests pass"
git push
```

Then go to github and confirm the push.
